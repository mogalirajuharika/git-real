If you are a DevOps engineer with a strategic understanding of tools, processes and utilization of technology, be assured that 2018 is going to be your year. According to Gartner, organizations around the world are increasingly adopting the DevOps culture and by the end of 2016, 25 percent of top global 2000 organizations have adopted DevOps as a mainstream strategy.

DevOps is a philosophy, a cultural shift that merges operations with development and demands a linked toolchain of technologies to facilitate collaborative change. Since the DevOps philosophy is still at a very nascent stage, application of DevOps as well as the bandwidth required  to adapt and collaborate, varies from organization to organization, yet we can talk about a winning formula of skills that can present you as a perfect candidate for any type of organization.

On top of fluency in web languages such as Ruby, Python, PHP or Java, the ideal DevOps engineer should have some experience using infrastructure automation tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack or Windows PowerShell DSC. Since DevOps is a cultural approach and not just a set of automation tools, organizations think about the requisite interpersonal skills that make DevOps practitioners successful. Cross-team communication and collaboration strategies may be harder to bring across the table, than technical competencies, but theyâ€™re no less important.
